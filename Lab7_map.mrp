  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.42

Peak Memory Usage:  250 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  9 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   2 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator CGEN/Mrom_font_rom0000121_15 failed to
   merge with F5 multiplexer CGEN/Mrom_font_rom0000121_14_f5.  There is a
   conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator CGEN/Mrom_font_rom0000481_162 failed
   to merge with F5 multiplexer CGEN/Mrom_font_rom0000481_15_f5_0.  There is a
   conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator PS21/count_and0000 failed to merge
   with F5 multiplexer PS21/count_not000122_f5.  There is a conflict for the
   FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Section 3 - Informational
